# simplicial homology
This repository helps to see simlicial homology in direct manner, given enumeration of faces which are in simplicial complexes of interest. This mainly makes use of python library named dionysus2 in the notion of zigzag homology to compute topological quantities. You'll find it more intriguing, visiting https://www.mrzv.org/software/dionysus2/.
